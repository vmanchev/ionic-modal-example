# ionic-modal-example
Example of Ionic Modal service and passing data bi-directional from controller to the modal and from modal to the controller

All the code is based on https://github.com/wataruoguchi/ionic-ui-modal-service/ and http://codepen.io/julianpaulozzi/pen/wBgpjM?editors=101 but I've simplified the code by removing the second confirmation dialog. The app.js file is now just 53 lines and the html file is even less.
